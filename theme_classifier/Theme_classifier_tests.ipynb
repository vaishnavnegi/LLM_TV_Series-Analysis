What\\u2019s that technique?\\n That\\u2019s just a jab\\u2026\\n Huh?!\\n However, it is the one used by Leaf Village\\u2019s number one technician.\\n That\\u2019s the only original technique of the Copy Ninja, Kakashi\\u2026\\n It\\u2019s the special technique used only for assassinations\\u2026\\n Its secret is in the speed of the jab,\\n and also the physical aptitude that gives forth a gigantic Chakra,\\n the ability of the Chakra to focus solely on the target,\\n and moreover the speed of the jab makes a \\u201cchichichichichi\\u201d sound\\u2026\\n A unique sound attack similar to the rumbling of a thousand birds.\\n And that\\u2019s why that technique is called\\u2026\\n Chidori: One Thousand Birds!\\n No way!

Cut through lightning?\\n Huh? That sounds fishy\\u2026\\n A-Awesome\\u2026\\n The real name of that technique is Chidori\\u2026\\n The secret is the speed of his jab that surpasses any human limitations\\n and the intensity of the Chakra on his arm\\u2026\\n And that arm turns virtually into the equivalent of the swing\\n of a celebrated sword that cuts through everything.\\n But what a reckless technique\\u2026\\n That\\u2019s not for you to say\\u2026\\n Right, Lee?\\n It\\u2019s beyond my scope of comprehension, but\\u2026\\n What an awesome technique!\\n I can understand it\\u2026\\n If it were me, if I made a running start at that speed,\\n I wouldn\\u2019t make a direct jab attack on the opponent\\u2026\\n Or rather, I couldn\\u2019t.\\n For an opponent,\\n a straight line attack just gives him an easy chance to launch a counterblow.\\n And moreover, I don\\u2019t have the eyes to read that counterblow.\\n I envy you\\u2026Sasuke!\\n When I fought you once, I said\\u2026\\n Even if one understands visually,\\n it\\u2019s meaningless unless one can move physically\\u2026\\n I was filled with a feeling of superiority.\\n But now, you have a body that moves at the same high speed as mine.\\n Moreover, you have\\u2026\\n the Sharingan!\\n I caught you!\\n Third Squadron.

Really?!\\n Sakura, you’re such a nice person.\\n It’s the first time in my life… you’ve been this nice to me!\\n H-Hey, Naruto. You’re exaggerating.\\n Naruto!\\n Wh-What’re you doing, Sakura?!\\n You touched my breast just now, didn’t you?!\\n I didn’t do anything like that!\\n Then, what’re those hairy hands sticking out from your armpit?!\\n What’s…that?\\n Huh? Huh?!\\n Wh-What’s this?!\\n Your back.\\n Huh?\\n Wh-What in the world is this?!\\n It’s a huge poop!\\n Idiot! That’s some kind of creature!\\n Is it a caterpillar?!\\n What?! Get it off.\\n No, this is an animal.\\n Let go!\\n Give me a break.\\n You guys, have you ever heard of the legend of Onbaa?\\n Onbaa?\\n I’ve never heard of it!\\n Shizune! You don’t know?\\n Nope. Is that legend something like an old tale or something?\\n That’s what I thought, but…\\n Long ago when I was young, I heard about a legend…\\n A legend about a dangerous, hairy, bear-like creature called Onbaa\\n who lived deep in the mountains near the village…\\n One day, that idiot Jiraiya eagerly went into the forest\\n saying he was going to investigate the Onbaa\\n for his summer vacation independent research.\\n The Pervy Sage?\\n Yes…\\n Are you an idiot?\\n Do you seriously think there’s an Onbaa?\\n Well, you’ll get yours when you see my independent research!\\n Who would?\\n Even if there were an Onbaa, it wouldn’t deal with you…\\n You said it! Flat-chested girl!\\n Who’s flat-chested?!\\n No way is there such a thing as an Onbaa!\\n You wanna bet on that?\\n Yeah! I’ll bet!\\n Then, I’ll bet on Jiraiya.\\n Huh?!\\n Then, I’m off to wrestle with an Onbaa!\\n And? Did the Pervy Sage meet an Onbaa?\\n When he came back three days later,\\n he said he won with a force-out move…\\n which most likely was a lie.\\n Oh! here it is.\\n Huh? What’s this?\\n What lousy writing!\\n You’re one to talk, Naruto.\\n Let’s see… The Onbaa is big. lt is nine-feet tall.\\n The Onbaa is scary.\\n No one is a match for it when it gets mad.\\n But I beat it at wrestling.\\n What’s this?\\n The Onbaa’s child likes being carried piggyback.\\n They grow up on the parent’s back.\\n What?!\\n What Jiraiya wrote is bogus, tracing the legend as is, but…\\n So there was an Onbaa…\\n Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing,\\n it stays piggyback on my back and won’t get off.\\n What should I do?\\n According to legend, the child Onbaa considers\\n the first thing it sees after birth as its parent\\n and clings to the back of that person.\\n It seems they grow that way, piggybacked on the parent,\\n until they become an adult.\\n It seems until then, they never leave the parent’s back.\\n Then, there’s no other way but to wait until it grows up.\\n You say that, but when it grows up…\\n it’ll turn into a scary nine-foot tall monster, right?\\n What’s up with that straightforward reaction?\\n Well, it’s a legend, so it’ll probably get off eventually…\\n Don’t be so irresponsible!\\n H-Hang in there, Naruto…\\n We’ll be cheering you on from behind the scenes.\\n Come up close rather than behind the scene, damn it!\\n What is it?\\n I won’t lose, you know!\\n This isn’t a weight, man!\\n What is it, Hinata?\\n Naruto… I heard a strange rumor.\\n A strange rumor…you say?\\n That you…umm…had a child.\\n Oh. You mean this?\\n Huh?! Hinata!\\n Hey! You okay?! Hinata!\\n Hinata, Hinata!\\n Hinata?!\\n What’s the deal? You’re sure an extravagant guy…\\n Oh!\\n Am I going to have to take a bath every time he pees on me?\\n Ichiraku Ramen\\n You know, we don’t allow pets.\\n The Leaf Village public health department is strict, you see.\\n I missed dinner because of him.\\n Overlook it just for today.\\n But now that I look closer, he’s cute, isn’t he?\\n So, what’s his name?\\n He’s saying it himself, so I guess Onbu is okay.\\n Onbu, huh…?\\n Doesn’t he want to eat some Naruto fish cake?\\n Here.\\n Old man! Give me a whole roll of Naruto!\\n Coming right up!\\n Ever since you clung to my back,\\n I’ve been getting nothing but odd jobs like this.\\n Well, I guess it can’t be helped…\\n He’s gotten big…! And so quickly…\\n This is bad!\\n Naruto Uzumaki, you are assigned a mission\\n for the removal of the mountain bandits from Yamabuki Pass!\\n Removal? Hey old lady…\\n Onbu’s gotten big,\\n so you intend to get rid of the troublemaker, right?\\n N-No, it’s not like that.\\n I was thinking you’ve had some eye-opening growth recently, so.\\n Then, what about the other members?\\n No…\\n Since you’ve shown such remarkable growth,\\n a solo infiltration should be fine.\\n Sure enough, it’s getting rid of the troublemaker!\\n This is also fate… Okay now, back to work.\\n Thanks, mister!\\n N-Naruto, Naruto.\\n Things are fun when you’re around, Onbu!\\n That Grandma Tsunade.\\n Don’t think you were able to get rid of the troublemaker so easily.\\n I’ll beat the mountain bandits and finish up this mission lickety-split\\n and the two of us will return to the Leaf Village with pride!\\n Right, Onbu?!\\n Hey! Mountain bandits! Come out!\\n Who’re you, creep?!\\n Who’re you?!\\n What do you want?!\\n I’m Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu!\\n Prepare yourselves!\\n – Say what?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t– Get him!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu! 184.01\\t02:29:44:16\\t02:29:45:10\\tOnbu!\\n Even knowing it’s a clone…\\n I won’t forgive those who hurt Onbu!\\n Heh! How was that?!\\n Die!\\n Onbu! You saved me!\\n Onbu… I owe you my life.\\n Let’s get back to the village quick and surprise everyone!\\n Onbu! No way will I believe that you’re a dangerous creature!\\n We’ll go as the Onbu-Naruto team succeeding the Kiba-Akamaru team!\\n What was that?\\n It’s okay…\\n You’ve got me with you.\\n Onbu?! No, it’s huge!\\n Could it be…you’re after Onbu?\\n Are you Onbu’s mom?!\\n W-W-W-Wait! I didn’t steal him!\\n Onbu! Say something, will you?!\\n Y-You idiot, Onbu!\\n No, y- you’ve got the wrong idea!\\n Onbu, it’s your mom.\\n It’s not my intention!\\n Damn it! I had a rough time of it.\\n If you're a mother,\\n then take better care of your child, really!\\n It’s okay! I’ll return Onbu to you! So rest easy.\\n Huh? My body got light.\\n Huh? Onbu? You got so big!\\n Huh, wha--? What’s the matter, Onbu?!\\n What’s the deal?!\\n W-W-W-Wait… Onbu, it’s me! Can’t you tell?!\\n We were getting along so well just a moment ago!\\n Please remember me!\\n It’s me! Naruto U-zu-ma-ki!\\n Oh, yeah! Naruto!\\n Naruto! Naruto!\\n Onbu, look at this!\\n Remember! Remember this spiral!\\n Naruto, Naruto!\\n You remember my back you clung to the whole time, don’t you?\\n Have I…had it?\\n Onbu…\\n I’m tired…\\n This feels kind of good…\\n It’s like I’m being carried piggyback.\\n Onbu…\\n Onbu!\\n Live in good health with your mom.\\n All right!\\n My sides…are splitting!\\n Onbaa is now no longer a legend.\\n They’re thriving in the village forest and seriously proliferating.\\n The stupid eagles carried them in, so.\\n Naruto! How’d you tear it off you?! Tell me!\\n Who knows? All I did was wrestle with Onbu.\\n Don’t be so mean!\\n At this rate, the village will be crushed.\\n Tell me! Naruto!\\n Don’t look at me.\\n Yesterday’s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.\\n In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.\\n Yellow Moon.\\n Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes\\n Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.\\n Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another’s back\\n Look at my eyes, when can we meet?\\n EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of\\n Right away, my messy feelings as is,\\n A magical chord change, in a restless city\\n A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key\\n Shino and I have been sent to a certain village to deal with\\n a dispute over a family head who passed away.\\n An old woman suddenly appears on the road and says this to us.\\n “Even dead men laugh in Motoyoshi Village.”\\n They were mysterious words. I never imagined it at this time.\\n To think I would see with my own eyes,\\n a sight in this village too frightening to even talk about…\\n Next: “Laughing Shino.”\\n I can’t even go to the bathroom alone at night.\\n\""

Is that legend something like an old tale or something?\\n That\\u2019s what I thought, but\\u2026\\n Long ago when I was young, I heard about a legend\\u2026\\n A legend about a dangerous, hairy, bear-like creature called Onbaa\\n who lived deep in the mountains near the village\\u2026\\n One day, that idiot Jiraiya eagerly went into the forest\\n saying he was going to investigate the Onbaa\\n for his summer vacation independent research.\\n The Pervy Sage?\\n Yes\\u2026\\n Are you an idiot?\\n Do you seriously think there\\u2019s an Onbaa?\\n Well, you\\u2019ll get yours when you see my independent research!\\n Who would?\\n Even if there were an Onbaa, it wouldn\\u2019t deal with you\\u2026\\n You said it! Flat-chested girl!\\n Who\\u2019s flat-chested?!\\n No way is there such a thing as an Onbaa!\\n You wanna bet on that?\\n Yeah! I\\u2019ll bet!\\n Then, I\\u2019ll bet on Jiraiya.\\n Huh?!\\n Then, I\\u2019m off to wrestle with an Onbaa!\\n And? Did the Pervy Sage meet an Onbaa?\\n When he came back three days later,\\n he said he won with a force-out move\\u2026\\n which most likely was a lie.\\n Oh! here it is.\\n Huh? What\\u2019s this?\\n What lousy writing!\\n You\\u2019re one to talk, Naruto.\\n Let\\u2019s see\\u2026 The Onbaa is big. lt is nine-feet tall.\\n The Onbaa is scary.\\n No one is a match for it when it gets mad.\\n But I beat it at wrestling.\\n What\\u2019s this?\\n The Onbaa\\u2019s child likes being carried piggyback.\\n They grow up on the parent\\u2019s back.\\n What?!\\n What Jiraiya wrote is bogus, tracing the legend as is, but\\u2026\\n So there was an Onbaa\\u2026\\n Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing,\\n it stays piggyback on my back and won\\u2019t get off.\\n What should I do?\\n According to legend, the child Onbaa considers\\n the first thing it sees after birth as its parent\\n and clings to the back of that person.\\n It seems they grow that way, piggybacked on the parent,\\n until they become an adult.\\n It seems until then, they never leave the parent\\u2019s back.\\n Then, there\\u2019s no other way but to wait until it grows up.\\n You say that, but when it grows up\\u2026\\n it\\u2019ll turn into a scary nine-foot tall monster, right?\\n What\\u2019s up with that straightforward reaction?\\n Well, it\\u2019s a legend, so it\\u2019ll probably get off eventually\\u2026\\n Don\\u2019t be so irresponsible!\\n H-Hang in there, Naruto\\u2026\\n We\\u2019ll be cheering you on from behind the scenes.\\n Come up close rather than behind the scene, damn it!\\n What is it?\\n I won\\u2019t lose, you know!\\n This isn\\u2019t a weight, man!\\n What is it, Hinata?\\n Naruto\\u2026 I heard a strange rumor.\\n A strange rumor\\u2026you say?\\n That you\\u2026umm\\u2026had a child.\\n Oh. You mean this?\\n Huh?! Hinata!\\n Hey! You okay?! Hinata!\\n Hinata, Hinata!\\n Hinata?!\\n What\\u2019s the deal? You\\u2019re sure an extravagant guy\\u2026\\n Oh!\\n Am I going to have to take a bath every time he pees on me?\\n Ichiraku Ramen\\n You know, we don\\u2019t allow pets.\\n The Leaf Village public health department is strict, you see.\\n I missed dinner because of him.\\n Overlook it just for today.\\n But now that I look closer, he\\u2019s cute, isn\\u2019t he?\\n So, what\\u2019s his name?\\n He\\u2019s saying it himself, so I guess Onbu is okay.\\n Onbu, huh\\u2026?\\n Doesn\\u2019t he want to eat some Naruto fish cake?\\n Here.\\n Old man! Give me a whole roll of Naruto!\\n Coming right up!\\n Ever since you clung to my back,\\n I\\u2019ve been getting nothing but odd jobs like this.\\n Well, I guess it can\\u2019t be helped\\u2026\\n He\\u2019s gotten big\\u2026! And so quickly\\u2026\\n This is bad!\\n Naruto Uzumaki, you are assigned a mission\\n for the removal of the mountain bandits from Yamabuki Pass!\\n Removal? Hey old lady\\u2026\\n Onbu\\u2019s gotten big,\\n so you intend to get rid of the troublemaker, right?\\n N-No, it\\u2019s not like that.\\n I was thinking you\\u2019ve had some eye-opening growth recently, so.\\n Then, what about the other members?\\n No\\u2026\\n Since you\\u2019ve shown such remarkable growth,\\n a solo infiltration should be fine.\\n Sure enough, it\\u2019s getting rid of the troublemaker!\\n This is also fate\\u2026 Okay now, back to work.\\n Thanks, mister!\\n N-Naruto, Naruto.\\n Things are fun when you\\u2019re around, Onbu!\\n That Grandma Tsunade.\\n Don\\u2019t think you were able to get rid of the troublemaker so easily.\\n I\\u2019ll beat the mountain bandits and finish up this mission lickety-split\\n and the two of us will return to the Leaf Village with pride!\\n Right, Onbu?!\\n Hey! Mountain bandits! Come out!\\n Who\\u2019re you, creep?!\\n Who\\u2019re you?!\\n What do you want?!\\n I\\u2019m Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu!\\n Prepare yourselves!\\n \\u2013 Say what?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Get him!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu! 184.01\\t02:29:44:16\\t02:29:45:10\\tOnbu!\\n Even knowing it\\u2019s a clone\\u2026\\n I won\\u2019t forgive those who hurt Onbu!\\n Heh! How was that?!\\n Die!\\n Onbu! You saved me!\\n Onbu\\u2026 I owe you my life.\\n Let\\u2019s get back to the village quick and surprise everyone!\\n Onbu! No way will I believe that you\\u2019re a dangerous creature!\\n We\\u2019ll go as the Onbu-Naruto team succeeding the Kiba-Akamaru team!\\n What was that?\\n It\\u2019s okay\\u2026\\n You\\u2019ve got me with you.\\n Onbu?! No, it\\u2019s huge!\\n Could it be\\u2026you\\u2019re after Onbu?\\n Are you Onbu\\u2019s mom?!\\n W-W-W-Wait! I didn\\u2019t steal him!\\n Onbu! Say something, will you?!\\n Y-You idiot, Onbu!\\n No, y- you\\u2019ve got the wrong idea!\\n Onbu, it\\u2019s your mom.\\n It\\u2019s not my intention!\\n Damn it! I had a rough time of it.\\n If you're a mother,\\n then take better care of your child, really!\\n It\\u2019s okay! I\\u2019ll return Onbu to you! So rest easy.\\n Huh? My body got light.\\n Huh? Onbu? You got so big!\\n Huh, wha--? What\\u2019s the matter, Onbu?!\\n What\\u2019s the deal?!\\n W-W-W-Wait\\u2026 Onbu, it\\u2019s me! Can\\u2019t you tell?!\\n We were getting along so well just a moment ago!\\n Please remember me!\\n It\\u2019s me! Naruto U-zu-ma-ki!\\n Oh, yeah! Naruto!\\n Naruto! Naruto!\\n Onbu, look at this!\\n Remember! Remember this spiral!\\n Naruto, Naruto!\\n You remember my back you clung to the whole time, don\\u2019t you?\\n Have I\\u2026had it?\\n Onbu\\u2026\\n I\\u2019m tired\\u2026\\n This feels kind of good\\u2026\\n It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m being carried piggyback.\\n Onbu\\u2026\\n Onbu!\\n Live in good health with your mom.\\n All right!\\n My sides\\u2026are splitting!\\n Onbaa is now no longer a legend.\\n They\\u2019re thriving in the village forest and seriously proliferating.\\n The stupid eagles carried them in, so.\\n Naruto! How\\u2019d you tear it off you?! Tell me!\\n Who knows? All I did was wrestle with Onbu.\\n Don\\u2019t be so mean!\\n At this rate, the village will be crushed.\\n Tell me! Naruto!\\n Don\\u2019t look at me.\\n Yesterday\\u2019s Call Sign, was all from my cell phone.\\n In a strange park, I play the Fuzz Guitar without enthusiasm.\\n Yellow Moon.\\n Even now, counting to three, I open my eyes\\n Shadow Moon I am still dreaming.\\n Look at my eyes, look at my eyes, as we face one another\\u2019s back\\n Look at my eyes, when can we meet?\\n EveryDay EveryNight With every word I can think of\\n Right away, my messy feelings as is,\\n A magical chord change, in a restless city\\n A daily JAZZ Guitar played in a soft minor key\\n Shino and I have been sent to a certain village to deal with\\n a dispute over a family head who passed away.\\n An old woman suddenly appears on the road and says this to us.\\n \\u201cEven dead men laugh in Motoyoshi Village.\\u201d\\n They were mysterious words.

You don\\u2019t know?\\n Nope. Is that legend something like an old tale or something?\\n That\\u2019s what I thought, but\\u2026\\n Long ago when I was young, I heard about a legend\\u2026\\n A legend about a dangerous, hairy, bear-like creature called Onbaa\\n who lived deep in the mountains near the village\\u2026\\n One day, that idiot Jiraiya eagerly went into the forest\\n saying he was going to investigate the Onbaa\\n for his summer vacation independent research.\\n The Pervy Sage?\\n Yes\\u2026\\n Are you an idiot?\\n Do you seriously think there\\u2019s an Onbaa?\\n Well, you\\u2019ll get yours when you see my independent research!\\n Who would?\\n Even if there were an Onbaa, it wouldn\\u2019t deal with you\\u2026\\n You said it! Flat-chested girl!\\n Who\\u2019s flat-chested?!\\n No way is there such a thing as an Onbaa!\\n You wanna bet on that?\\n Yeah! I\\u2019ll bet!\\n Then, I\\u2019ll bet on Jiraiya.\\n Huh?!\\n Then, I\\u2019m off to wrestle with an Onbaa!\\n And? Did the Pervy Sage meet an Onbaa?\\n When he came back three days later,\\n he said he won with a force-out move\\u2026\\n which most likely was a lie.\\n Oh! here it is.\\n Huh? What\\u2019s this?\\n What lousy writing!\\n You\\u2019re one to talk, Naruto.\\n Let\\u2019s see\\u2026 The Onbaa is big. lt is nine-feet tall.\\n The Onbaa is scary.\\n No one is a match for it when it gets mad.\\n But I beat it at wrestling.\\n What\\u2019s this?\\n The Onbaa\\u2019s child likes being carried piggyback.\\n They grow up on the parent\\u2019s back.\\n What?!\\n What Jiraiya wrote is bogus, tracing the legend as is, but\\u2026\\n So there was an Onbaa\\u2026\\n Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing,\\n it stays piggyback on my back and won\\u2019t get off.\\n What should I do?\\n According to legend, the child Onbaa considers\\n the first thing it sees after birth as its parent\\n and clings to the back of that person.\\n It seems they grow that way, piggybacked on the parent,\\n until they become an adult.\\n It seems until then, they never leave the parent\\u2019s back.\\n Then, there\\u2019s no other way but to wait until it grows up.\\n You say that, but when it grows up\\u2026\\n it\\u2019ll turn into a scary nine-foot tall monster, right?\\n What\\u2019s up with that straightforward reaction?\\n Well, it\\u2019s a legend, so it\\u2019ll probably get off eventually\\u2026\\n Don\\u2019t be so irresponsible!\\n H-Hang in there, Naruto\\u2026\\n We\\u2019ll be cheering you on from behind the scenes.\\n Come up close rather than behind the scene, damn it!\\n What is it?\\n I won\\u2019t lose, you know!\\n This isn\\u2019t a weight, man!\\n What is it, Hinata?\\n Naruto\\u2026 I heard a strange rumor.\\n A strange rumor\\u2026you say?\\n That you\\u2026umm\\u2026had a child.\\n Oh. You mean this?\\n Huh?! Hinata!\\n Hey! You okay?! Hinata!\\n Hinata, Hinata!\\n Hinata?!\\n What\\u2019s the deal? You\\u2019re sure an extravagant guy\\u2026\\n Oh!\\n Am I going to have to take a bath every time he pees on me?\\n Ichiraku Ramen\\n You know, we don\\u2019t allow pets.\\n The Leaf Village public health department is strict, you see.\\n I missed dinner because of him.\\n Overlook it just for today.\\n But now that I look closer, he\\u2019s cute, isn\\u2019t he?\\n So, what\\u2019s his name?\\n He\\u2019s saying it himself, so I guess Onbu is okay.\\n Onbu, huh\\u2026?\\n Doesn\\u2019t he want to eat some Naruto fish cake?\\n Here.\\n Old man! Give me a whole roll of Naruto!\\n Coming right up!\\n Ever since you clung to my back,\\n I\\u2019ve been getting nothing but odd jobs like this.\\n Well, I guess it can\\u2019t be helped\\u2026\\n He\\u2019s gotten big\\u2026! And so quickly\\u2026\\n This is bad!\\n Naruto Uzumaki, you are assigned a mission\\n for the removal of the mountain bandits from Yamabuki Pass!\\n Removal? Hey old lady\\u2026\\n Onbu\\u2019s gotten big,\\n so you intend to get rid of the troublemaker, right?\\n N-No, it\\u2019s not like that.\\n I was thinking you\\u2019ve had some eye-opening growth recently, so.\\n Then, what about the other members?\\n No\\u2026\\n Since you\\u2019ve shown such remarkable growth,\\n a solo infiltration should be fine.\\n Sure enough, it\\u2019s getting rid of the troublemaker!\\n This is also fate\\u2026 Okay now, back to work.\\n Thanks, mister!\\n N-Naruto, Naruto.\\n Things are fun when you\\u2019re around, Onbu!\\n That Grandma Tsunade.\\n Don\\u2019t think you were able to get rid of the troublemaker so easily.\\n I\\u2019ll beat the mountain bandits and finish up this mission lickety-split\\n and the two of us will return to the Leaf Village with pride!\\n Right, Onbu?!\\n Hey! Mountain bandits! Come out!\\n Who\\u2019re you, creep?!\\n Who\\u2019re you?!\\n What do you want?!\\n I\\u2019m Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu!\\n Prepare yourselves!\\n \\u2013 Say what?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Get him!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu! 184.01\\t02:29:44:16\\t02:29:45:10\\tOnbu!\\n Even knowing it\\u2019s a clone\\u2026\\n I won\\u2019t forgive those who hurt Onbu!\\n Heh! How was that?!\\n Die!\\n Onbu! You saved me!\\n Onbu\\u2026 I owe you my life.\\n Let\\u2019s get back to the village quick and surprise everyone!\\n Onbu! No way will I believe that you\\u2019re a dangerous creature!\\n We\\u2019ll go as the Onbu-Naruto team succeeding the Kiba-Akamaru team!\\n What was that?\\n It\\u2019s okay\\u2026\\n You\\u2019ve got me with you.\\n Onbu?! No, it\\u2019s huge!\\n Could it be\\u2026you\\u2019re after Onbu?\\n Are you Onbu\\u2019s mom?!\\n W-W-W-Wait! I didn\\u2019t steal him!\\n Onbu! Say something, will you?!\\n Y-You idiot, Onbu!\\n No, y- you\\u2019ve got the wrong idea!\\n Onbu, it\\u2019s your mom.\\n It\\u2019s not my intention!\\n Damn it! I had a rough time of it.\\n If you're a mother,\\n then take better care of your child, really!\\n It\\u2019s okay! I\\u2019ll return Onbu to you! So rest easy.\\n Huh? My body got light.\\n Huh? Onbu? You got so big!\\n Huh, wha--? What\\u2019s the matter, Onbu?!\\n What\\u2019s the deal?!\\n W-W-W-Wait\\u2026 Onbu, it\\u2019s me! Can\\u2019t you tell?!\\n We were getting along so well just a moment ago!\\n Please remember me!\\n It\\u2019s me! Naruto U-zu-ma-ki!\\n Oh, yeah! Naruto!\\n Naruto! Naruto!\\n Onbu, look at this!\\n Remember! Remember this spiral!\\n Naruto, Naruto!\\n You remember my back you clung to the whole time, don\\u2019t you?\\n Have I\\u2026had it?\\n Onbu\\u2026\\n I\\u2019m tired\\u2026\\n This feels kind of good\\u2026\\n It\\u2019s like I\\u2019m being carried piggyback.\\n Onbu\\u2026\\n Onbu!\\n Live in good health with your mom.\\n All right!\\n My sides\\u2026are splitting!\\n Onbaa is now no longer a legend.\\n They\\u2019re thriving in the village forest and seriously proliferating.\\n The stupid eagles carried them in, so.\\n Naruto! How\\u2019d you tear it off you?! Tell me!\\n Who knows? All I did was wrestle with Onbu.\\n Don\\u2019t be so mean!\\n At this rate, the village will be crushed.\\n Tell me!

You don\\u2019t know?\\n Nope. Is that legend something like an old tale or something?\\n That\\u2019s what I thought, but\\u2026\\n Long ago when I was young, I heard about a legend\\u2026\\n A legend about a dangerous, hairy, bear-like creature called Onbaa\\n who lived deep in the mountains near the village\\u2026\\n One day, that idiot Jiraiya eagerly went into the forest\\n saying he was going to investigate the Onbaa\\n for his summer vacation independent research.\\n The Pervy Sage?\\n Yes\\u2026\\n Are you an idiot?\\n Do you seriously think there\\u2019s an Onbaa?\\n Well, you\\u2019ll get yours when you see my independent research!\\n Who would?\\n Even if there were an Onbaa, it wouldn\\u2019t deal with you\\u2026\\n You said it! Flat-chested girl!\\n Who\\u2019s flat-chested?!\\n No way is there such a thing as an Onbaa!\\n You wanna bet on that?\\n Yeah! I\\u2019ll bet!\\n Then, I\\u2019ll bet on Jiraiya.\\n Huh?!\\n Then, I\\u2019m off to wrestle with an Onbaa!\\n And? Did the Pervy Sage meet an Onbaa?\\n When he came back three days later,\\n he said he won with a force-out move\\u2026\\n which most likely was a lie.\\n Oh! here it is.\\n Huh? What\\u2019s this?\\n What lousy writing!\\n You\\u2019re one to talk, Naruto.\\n Let\\u2019s see\\u2026 The Onbaa is big. lt is nine-feet tall.\\n The Onbaa is scary.\\n No one is a match for it when it gets mad.\\n But I beat it at wrestling.\\n What\\u2019s this?\\n The Onbaa\\u2019s child likes being carried piggyback.\\n They grow up on the parent\\u2019s back.\\n What?!\\n What Jiraiya wrote is bogus, tracing the legend as is, but\\u2026\\n So there was an Onbaa\\u2026\\n Grandma Tsunade, as for this thing,\\n it stays piggyback on my back and won\\u2019t get off.\\n What should I do?\\n According to legend, the child Onbaa considers\\n the first thing it sees after birth as its parent\\n and clings to the back of that person.\\n It seems they grow that way, piggybacked on the parent,\\n until they become an adult.\\n It seems until then, they never leave the parent\\u2019s back.\\n Then, there\\u2019s no other way but to wait until it grows up.\\n You say that, but when it grows up\\u2026\\n it\\u2019ll turn into a scary nine-foot tall monster, right?\\n What\\u2019s up with that straightforward reaction?\\n Well, it\\u2019s a legend, so it\\u2019ll probably get off eventually\\u2026\\n Don\\u2019t be so irresponsible!\\n H-Hang in there, Naruto\\u2026\\n We\\u2019ll be cheering you on from behind the scenes.\\n Come up close rather than behind the scene, damn it!\\n What is it?\\n I won\\u2019t lose, you know!\\n This isn\\u2019t a weight, man!\\n What is it, Hinata?\\n Naruto\\u2026 I heard a strange rumor.\\n A strange rumor\\u2026you say?\\n That you\\u2026umm\\u2026had a child.\\n Oh. You mean this?\\n Huh?! Hinata!\\n Hey! You okay?! Hinata!\\n Hinata, Hinata!\\n Hinata?!\\n What\\u2019s the deal? You\\u2019re sure an extravagant guy\\u2026\\n Oh!\\n Am I going to have to take a bath every time he pees on me?\\n Ichiraku Ramen\\n You know, we don\\u2019t allow pets.\\n The Leaf Village public health department is strict, you see.\\n I missed dinner because of him.\\n Overlook it just for today.\\n But now that I look closer, he\\u2019s cute, isn\\u2019t he?\\n So, what\\u2019s his name?\\n He\\u2019s saying it himself, so I guess Onbu is okay.\\n Onbu, huh\\u2026?\\n Doesn\\u2019t he want to eat some Naruto fish cake?\\n Here.\\n Old man! Give me a whole roll of Naruto!\\n Coming right up!\\n Ever since you clung to my back,\\n I\\u2019ve been getting nothing but odd jobs like this.\\n Well, I guess it can\\u2019t be helped\\u2026\\n He\\u2019s gotten big\\u2026!

Mountain bandits! Come out!\\n Who\\u2019re you, creep?!\\n Who\\u2019re you?!\\n What do you want?!\\n I\\u2019m Naruto Uzumaki with my kid Onbu!\\n Prepare yourselves!\\n \\u2013 Say what?! \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u2013 Get him!\\n Shadow Clone Jutsu! 184.01\\t02:29:44:16\\t02:29:45:10\\tOnbu!\\n Even knowing it\\u2019s a clone\\u2026\\n I won\\u2019t forgive those who hurt Onbu!\\n Heh!

No, it\\u2019s huge!\\n Could it be\\u2026you\\u2019re after Onbu?\\n Are you Onbu\\u2019s mom?!\\n W-W-W-Wait! I didn\\u2019t steal him!\\n Onbu! Say something, will you?!\\n Y-You idiot, Onbu!\\n No, y- you\\u2019ve got the wrong idea!\\n Onbu, it\\u2019s your mom.\\n It\\u2019s not my intention!\\n Damn it!
